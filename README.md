# Random Quote Generator
This is a Python-based application that fetches and displays random quotes from an online API. It includes a GUI with functionality to retrieve a new quote and an option to read the quote aloud using text-to-speech. The app uses PyQt5 for its graphical interface and requests for API communication.
